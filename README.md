# rock-paper-scissors-game
This is a rock, paper, scissors game to showcase my understanding of JavaScript; its functions and logic.

Only works through the console. The user gets prompted for a choice of rock, paper, or scissors. Then we check the choice
against a random choice for the computer and alert the outcome. A whole round consists of 5 games.
